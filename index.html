    <ul>
      <li>Origins of frozen desserts are obscure but there are accounts of ice-cream-like foods as early as 550BC in Persia.</li>
      <li>Vanilla was first used in Mexico by the Mesoamerican people. Spanish conquistadors brought vanilla back with them to Spain in the 1510’s, after exploring Mexico and seeing the locals consuming it with cacao.</li>
      <li>There is evidence of ice cream being eaten in the Mughal Empire in the sixteenth century. Horsemen were sent to bring back blocks of ice to be used in fruit sorbets and kulfi, a “traditional Indian ice cream”.</li>
      <li>The act of using ice and salt to freeze desserts wasn’t mentioned in European literature until the end of the sixteenth century. This practice was thought to have been brought over from Asia.</li>
      <li>The first mentions of ice cream in Europe were from Italian duchess Catherine de’ Medici when she married the French Duke of Orleans (later Henry II of France) in 1533.</li>
      <li>The first recorded mention of ice cream in England was in 1671 when Elias Ashmole described the dishes served at the Feast of St George at Windsor Castle for King Charles II. Ice cream was such an exclusive dish that reportedly the only table with a plate of it was that of the King.</li>
      <li>The earliest North American reference to ice cream is from 1744 by the wife of Governor Bland, but it’s popularity quickly spread across the continent amongst the elite.</li>
      <li>In 1841 an enslaved child named Edmond Albius discovered that the Vanilla Orchid could be hand-pollinated, which allowed global cultivation of the plant. Soon vanilla went from an ingredient for the rich to an ice cream staple.</li>
      <li>In the late 1800’s Agnes Marshall, regarded as the “Queen of Ices”, popularised the sweet treat with her cookery books and lectures. She did much to publicise new techniques and is widely thought to be the inventor of the modern ice cream cone.</li>
      <li>In the 20th century ice cream evolved to become more widespread and available with ice cream soda shops and ice cream parlors becoming popular places to socialise.</li>
      <li>In the second half of the 20th century ice cream became a common place treat in many countries as cheap refrigeration became commonplace.</li>
      <li>There was soon an explosion of ice cream shops like Baskin-Robbins whose “31 flavors” motto was popular with consumers.</li>
      <li>The 1980’s saw thicker “premium” and “super-premium” ice creams coming to the forefront under brands such as Ben & Jerry’s and Häagen-Dazs.</li>
      <li>The 2000’s saw the globalisation of flavours. So where consumers might have only seen Mango flavour in India and Pandan flavour in Indonesia, they were able to try these flavours in their local ice cream shop or supermarket. This saw a global increase in sales of flavours like Pistachio, Matcha and Black Sesame to name but a few.</li>
      <li>With the increase in plant-based diets and greater understanding of food intolerances, the 2010’s and 2020’s saw the introduction of new ice creams catering to people following gluten free, nut free and vegan lifestyles.</li>
      <li>Today in the UK alone the ice cream market is valued at over £2.46 billion! That’s a lot of ice cream!</li>
